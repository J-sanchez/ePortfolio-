## Self-Assessment

Reflecting on my journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), I can confidently say it has been a transformative and challenging experience. Throughout my studies, I've gained technical expertise and a deeper understanding of what it takes to succeed in the competitive field of computer science. Having transferred three times before, SNHU's program stands out for its comprehensive curriculum and real-world practical experiences. It has far surpassed the quality of education at my previous institutions.

### Strengths and Professional Goals

The coursework in this program has been demanding, but it helped me develop crucial skills for my career. Late-night study sessions and weekend work taught me time management, discipline, and how to set priorities. Balancing school with a full-time job was difficult but pushed me to go beyond my limits, and I made significant sacrifices in my personal life to focus on my academic goals.

These experiences have shaped my resilience and work ethic, while enhancing my communication skills and ability to work under pressureâ€”critical abilities for my future roles in computer science.

### Skills Developed and Professional Competence

- **Technical Writing and Code Documentation**: I've honed my ability to write clear, detailed documentation, making code easier to understand and maintain. This skill became crucial during coursework, where thorough documentation was necessary for future developers and testers to work with the code effectively.

- **Perseverance and Problem-Solving**: Despite facing overwhelming challenges, I learned how to break complex problems into manageable parts and approach tasks with determination. This mindset has prepared me to tackle difficult problems with confidence.

- **Algorithm Optimization and Data Structures**: Through courses like Data Structures and Algorithms, I learned key concepts such as sorting algorithms and hash tables, and how to optimize them for better performance and efficiency.

- **Software Development and Database Management**: I gained expertise in software engineering and database management, which allowed me to build efficient software, perform testing, and design scalable databases.

- **Security**: I've developed an understanding of security best practices, including encryption and identifying vulnerabilities. This knowledge is crucial for building secure systems from the ground up.
