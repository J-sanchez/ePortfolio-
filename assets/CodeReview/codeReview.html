        <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Code Review is for a Java-based SlideShow app from CS 250, displaying images and text descriptions with "Previous" and "Next" buttons. It uses multiple panels and a CardLayout for smooth transitions.</p>

<p><strong>Enhancements & Reflections:</strong><br>
- The original code is functional but could benefit from improved variable naming, more flexible layout management, and code optimization (e.g., reducing redundant code and streamlining button setup).<br>
- The app could handle missing resources better and improve efficiency with data management, using layout managers, and adding error checks.</p>

<p><stong>Suggested Improvements:</stong><br>
- Store slide data in arrays to reduce redundancy, use ImageIcon for images, and refactor the code for better structure.<br>
- Add error handling for missing resources and focus on modularity for scalability.</p>

<p><strong>Future Enhancements:</strong><br>
- Transition to a web-based interface for a more interactive user experience and optimize performance for faster load times.<br>
- Improve code quality with detailed comments and unit tests for future maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> With modernized design, clearer code, and improved performance, the app could become a more scalable and user-friendly tool.</p>
